//To be done

Game: 2 player pvp Text game (maybe an ai)


Fighters will have random(?) stats
Stats:
Strength (0-10)
	HP (1-50)
Damage system
Roll for stats (max 3 times?) 
Reroll 

Turn system (random for who starts)


Classes: Player,  Fighter selection (3 choices), playerAI(?)

Draft: 
-> Both players choose one of three fighters (unless ai maybe??)
-> Turn will be decided
-> Game begins
	-> player 1 then player 2 loop until hp=0
-> Players can chose to attack or defend 
	- defense 0-10 = no block
	- 11-19 = damage reduction
	- 20 = full block


Addons
Give each fighter a fighter specific boost

Things we have to do:
AI player
Fighter stats randomizing
Turns system
